#' bank 
#' 
#' Bank data from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The raw bank data have been processed
#' and an \code{outcome} column added. 
#' 
#' Description (copied from UCI):
#' 
#' The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 
#' There are four datasets: 
#' 
#' 1) (included in \code{predtmle}) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]
#' 
#' 2) bank-additional.csv with 10\% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs.
#' 
#' 3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs). 
#' 
#' 4) bank.csv with 10\% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs). 
#' 
#' The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM). 
#' The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
#' 
#' Attribute Information:
#' 
#' Input variables:

#' default
#' 
#' "Default of credit card clients" data from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Raw data have been
#' processed and an \code{outcome} column added. 
#' 
#' Data Set Information (copied from UCI):
#' 
#' This research aimed at the case of customers default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining methods. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel "Sorting Smoothing Method" to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among the six data mining techniques, artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.
#' 
#' Attribute Information:
#' 
#' This research employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. This study reviewed the literature and used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables: 
#' 
#' X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit. 
#' 
#' X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female). 
#' 
#' X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others). 
#' 
#' X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others). 
#' 
#' X5: Age (year). 
#' 
#' X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above. 
#' 
#' X12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005. 
#' 
#' X18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005.

#' drugs
#' 
#' "Drug consumption (quantified) Data Set" from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
#' Raw data have been processed and an \code{outcome} (heroin use) column added.
#' 
#' Data Set Information (copied from UCI library):
#' 
#' Database contains records for 1885 respondents. For each respondent 12 attributes are known: Personality measurements which include NEO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), BIS-11 (impulsivity), and ImpSS (sensation seeking), level of education, age, gender, country of residence and ethnicity. All input attributes are originally categorical and are quantified. After quantification values of all input features can be considered as real-valued. In addition, participants were questioned concerning their use of 18 legal and illegal drugs (alcohol, amphetamines, amyl nitrite, benzodiazepine, cannabis, chocolate, cocaine, caffeine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, mushrooms, nicotine and volatile substance abuse and one fictitious drug (Semeron) which was introduced to identify over-claimers. For each drug they have to select one of the answers: never used the drug, used it over a decade ago, or in the last decade, year, month, week, or day.
#' 
#' Database contains 18 classification problems. Each of independent label variables contains seven classes: "Never Used", "Used over a Decade Ago", "Used in Last Decade", "Used in Last Year", "Used in Last Month", "Used in Last Week", and "Used in Last Day".
#' 
#' Problem which can be solved:
#' 
#' * Seven class classifications for each drug separately.
#' 
#' * Problem can be transformed to binary classification by union of part of classes into one new class. For example, "Never Used", "Used over a Decade Ago" form class "Non-user" and all other classes form class "User".
#' 
#' * The best binarization of classes for each attribute.
#' 
#' * Evaluation of risk to be drug consumer for each drug.
#' 
#' Detailed description of database and process of data quantification are presented in E. Fehrman, A. K. Muhammad, E. M. Mirkes, V. Egan and A. N. Gorban, "The Five Factor Model of personality and evaluation of drug consumption risk.," arXiv [Web Link], 2015

#' 
#' "MAGIC Gamma Telescope Data Set" from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Raw data have
#' been processed and an \code{outcome} column added. 
#' 
#' Data Set Information (copied from UCI):
#' 
#' The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background). 
#' Typically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions. 
#' 
#' The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in: 
#' 
#' D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers, 
#' Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).
#' 
#' The program was run with parameters allowing to observe events with energies down to below 50 GeV.

#' 
#' g = gamma (signal): 12332 
#' 
#' h = hadron (background): 6688 
#' 
#' For technical reasons, the number of h events is underestimated. In the real data, the h class represents the majority of the events. 
#' 
#' The simple classification accuracy is not meaningful for this data, since classifying a background event as signal is worse than classifying a signal event as background. For comparison of different classifiers an ROC curve has to be used. The relevant points on this curve are those, where the probability of accepting a background event as signal is below one of the following thresholds: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 depending on the required quality of the sample of the accepted events for different experiments.

#' 
#' "Wine Quality" data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The red and white wine data sets
#' have been combined with an added attribute for red vs. white. 
#' 
#' Data Set Information (copied from UCI):
#' 
#' The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). 
#' 
#' These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

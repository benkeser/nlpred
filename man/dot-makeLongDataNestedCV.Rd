\title{Worker function to make long form data set needed for
CVTMLE targeting step when nested cv is used}
\usage{
.makeLongDataNestedCV(x, prediction_list, folds, gn, update = FALSE,
  epsilon_0 = 0, epsilon_1 = 0, tol = 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The outer validation fold}

\item{prediction_list}{The full prediction list}

\item{folds}{Vector of CV folds}

\item{gn}{An estimate of the marginal dist. of Y}

\item{update}{Boolean of whether this is called for initial
construction of the long data set or as part of the targeting loop. 
If the former, cross-validated empirical "density" estimates are used. 
If the latter these are derived from the targeted cdf.}

\item{epsilon_0}{If \code{update = TRUE}, a vector of TMLE fluctuation
parameter estimates used to add the CDF and PDF of Psi(X) to the data set}

\item{epsilon_1}{Ditto above}

\item{tol}{A truncation level when taking logit transformations.}
}
\value{
A long form data list of a particular set up. Columns are named id 
(multiple per obs. in validation sample), u (if Yi = 0, these are the unique 
values of psi(x) in the inner validation samples for psi fit on inner training
samples for obs with Y = 1, if Yi = 1, these are values of psi(x) in
the inner validation samples for psi fit on inner training samples for obs. 
with Y = 0), Yi (this id's value of Y), Fn (cross-validation estimated value 
of the cdf of psi(X) given Y = Yi in the training sample), 
dFn (cross-validated estimate of the density of psi(X) given Y = (1-Yi) in the 
training sample), psi (the value of this observations Psihat(P_{n,B_n}^0)),
gn (estimate of marginal of Y e.g., computed in whole sample), outcome (indicator
that psix <= u), logit_Fn (the cdf estimate on the logit scale, needed for 
offset in targeting model).

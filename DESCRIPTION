Title: Estimators of Non-Linear Cross-Validated Risks Optimized for Small Samples 
Version: 1.0.1
Authors@R: person("David", "Benkeser", email = "benkeser@emory.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Methods for obtaining improved estimates of non-linear cross-validated risks are obtained using targeted minimum loss-based estimation, estimating equations, and one-step estimation. Cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (LeDell, Petersen, van der Laan (2015), <doi:10.1214/15-EJS1035>) and other metrics are included.

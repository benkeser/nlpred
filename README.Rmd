> Small-sample optimized estimators of cross-validated prediction metrics

[David Benkeser](https://www.benkeserstatistics.com/) 

---

## Description

`nlpred` is an R package for computing estimates of cross-validated prediction metrics. These estimates are tailored for superior performance in small samples. Several estimators are available including ones based cross-validated targeted minimum loss-based estimation, estimating equations, and one-step estimation. 

---

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nlpred")
```

You can install the current release of `nlpred` from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("benkeser/nlpred")
```
---

## Usage

The main functions in the package are `cv_auc` and `cv_scrnp`, which are used to 
compute, respectively, the `K`-fold [cross-validated area under the receiver operating
characteristics curve](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ejs/1437742107) (CVAUC) and 
the `K`-fold cross-validated [sensitivity constrained rate of negative prediction](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.7296). However, rather than using
standard cross-validation estimators (where prediction algorithms are developed in a 
training sample and AUC/SCRNP estimated using the validation sample), we instead use
techniques from efficiency theory to estimate these quantities. This allows us to use
the training data both to develop the prediction algorithm, *as well as* key nuisance 
parameters needed to evaluate AUC/SCRNP. By reserving more data for estimation of these
key parameters, we obtain improved performance in small samples. 

```{r}
# load package
library(nlpred)

# turn off messages from np package
options(np.messages=FALSE)

# simulate data
n <- 200
p <- 10
X <- data.frame(matrix(rnorm(n*p), nrow = n, ncol = p))
Y <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(X[,1] + X[,10]))

# get cv auc estimates for logistic regression
logistic_cv_auc_ests <- cv_auc(Y = Y, X = X, K = 5, learner = "glm_wrapper")
logistic_cv_auc_ests

# get cv auc estimates for random forest using nested 
# cross-validation for nuisance parameter estimation. nested
# cross-validation is unfortunately necessary when aggressive learners 
# are used. 
rf_cv_auc_ests <- cv_auc(Y = Y, X = X, K = 5, 
						 learner = "randomforest_wrapper", 
						 nested_cv = TRUE)
rf_cv_auc_ests

# same examples for scrnp
logistic_cv_scrnp_ests <- cv_scrnp(Y = Y, X = X, K = 5, learner = "glm_wrapper")
logistic_cv_scrnp_ests


rf_cv_scrnp_ests <- cv_scrnp(Y = Y, X = X, K = 5, 
						 learner = "randomforest_wrapper", 
						 nested_cv = TRUE)
rf_cv_scrnp_ests
```
